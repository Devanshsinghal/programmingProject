# programmingProject
In this Project, I have included two different maze programs
1) maze.c - this takes a file input and then runs some checks and open the maze to be played.

2) maze(custom).c = this takes custom input from user for the height and width of the maze and generates a maze based on the provided dimensions with random number of walls inside the maze.

According to brief provided for the project , i couldnt understand the proper requirement byt i created two different programs 
The custom maze is an extra effort program (just in case)
the main program to be checked is maze.c
